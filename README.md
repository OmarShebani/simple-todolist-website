# simple-todolist-website
This project is a simple TodoList website, in which you can add a list of what you want to do later or some notes.


For it to work, you need to download MYSQLi extension so that it can interact with the database.

NOTE:
There are some issues with the edit-account.php file, also the create-database.php file doesn't work so you have to create the database manually.
